<h1>Buy Pixels <span>(1/3)</span></h1>

<p>Select pixels blocks that are next to each other, to reserve space for your image.</p>
<p>You can upload a photo of yourself, something you like, a corporate logo or image – the sky’s the limit. You can also choose a URL for your image to link to when the pixel grid is shown on this website.</p>
<p>Once all of the matrix of available space has been sold we will amalgamate the images and pass it to the in-house Mission Motorsport livery studio. Using their state of the art Roland printing equipment they will create a single huge image that will take pride of place on the side of the race truck for one year.</p>
