*             If you see an %s within the text, this is a placeholder which will

*             the %s but integrate it at the right place in your text.
*             i.e.
*                   $_SP[0] = "You can choose %s blocks for free!";
*
*             ...will shown on the website like

*
*             Furthermore make sure, that you do not use " within your text, because
*             it is interpreted as code. Use &quot; or \" instead.
*
*             If you will get an error on your webpage (white site) you likely made this
